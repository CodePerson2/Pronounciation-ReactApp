## Node Server For Speech-To-Text Translation

## Made By: Mattias Stroman

### React Front End: https://github.com/CodePerson2/SimbiDevReact/tree/master

I created a simple react front end in typescript to interact with the node server

The project did not become completed. I did not relize that there was an assignment for this interview
until the moring of may the 3rd. This gave me little time to complete the assignment, having other duties
that day.

#### What I did complete.

-Nodejs server running express<br>
-Serves a built React app<br>
-Socket.io used for front to backend communication<br>
-Set up google speech to text api<br>
-Used MediaRecorder to take 1 sec media recordings<br>
-sent mp3 files to node server<br>
-coverts mp3 to LINEAR16<br>
-responds to react app with text<br>


#### what I need to fix/complete:

-all mp3 files being sent arent being translated to linear16<br>
and sent to google api<br>
-because of that all speech isnt being sent back<br>
-React app doesnt display sentences/phrases and highlights words properly pronounced<br>


Because of the time crunch I brought upon my self I have been unable to do a proper<br>
refactoring and commenting of the code
